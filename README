To compile project just type make. proj1 will be the name of the executable.
Make clean will remove the executable.

My program works by continuously retrieving the next number from the input file. These are then
placed into an array and written backwards into the output file suceeding
the pid within each child process. Child ids are written to a temp file and added at the end of the outputfile
before the temp file is deleted.


testfile.txt is one of the files I used to test my program

One thing I noticed while testing my program was that some of the forked proceses
finish before some of the earlier ones that are started, and so they can be out of order
in the outputfile.

Options:
An input file needs to be specified with -i option or else an error will be given if input.dat doesn't already exist.If the outputfIle given by the user doesn't exist, then one will be created usin
the outputfilename entered. If no outputfilename is entered then a file, output.dat will be created to store the pids and numbers.
